The motivation behind this project was to make it easier for a person to navigate through the website easily. What was changed was removing div tags so it wont be so repetetive, make the name of the browser/page is not vague, and in the css section making sure every line is not so repetitive. It helped solve solve making sure all classes were organized, adding comments to css file to help organize and help make people know what is happening I learned to use Html coding to make a website as well as fix websites that did not work, even making organized for future employers to see 

## Installation

The steps to fix this index.html and css.style is adding comments fixing the title of the page, looking over the code constistantly for example in line 31 I had a realization that i needed to change and add an id because there was already a class, also adding alt after all the images after looking at a source online that says all images require it.
